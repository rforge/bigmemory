# synchronicity is currently only supported on unix platforms
# because of a bug in either Boost or MinGW with 64-bit Windows.
# We'll expand support to Windows as soon as these have been
# resolved.
#
# If you want to use this package with 32-bit Windows, it may be
# possible (comment out the OS_type line in DESCRIPTION).
