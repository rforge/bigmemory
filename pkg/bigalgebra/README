Notable changes:

0.7.1 18-November-2011: Vastly simplified core linear algebra dependencies,
focusing on provided reference BLAS and LAPACK routines. We removed all
configure files and fancy configuration options for 3rd party libraries,
as they are very difficult to uniformly support across platforms. Advanced
users desiring 3rd party BLAS and LAPACK support can modify the package
Makevars files, or include custom configure files as required.
