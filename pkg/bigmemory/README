1. Removed boost/interprocess/containers/detail since it was empty.
2. os_file_functions.hpp: Changed line 125 from

  if(size > filesize){

  to 

  if(size > static_cast<std::size_t>(filesize)){

  to get rid of the compiler warning.

3. seed_rng.hpp: Changed line 150 from

  std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );
 
  to 

  size_t temp = std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );
