* The configuration process has been streamlined to avoid
  warnings and allow for support of Sun Studio compiler
  on Linux.

* bigmemory >= 2.2.0 is accompanied by sister packages
  biganalytics and bigtabulate; mutexes (locking) are
  abstracted to package synchronicity, available now
  on R-Forge and soon to be uploaded to CRAN.  Package
  bigalgebra is on R-Forge as a beta version while we
  sort through the range of library configuration options.
